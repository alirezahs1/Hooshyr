					<p className="mb-4">
						My journey began with a passion for the creation of things, and programming doubled it.
					</p> 
					<p className="mb-4">
						I started my programming career in high school with Html and CSS. Subsequently, I learned how to implement PHP and WordPress themes and became an expert in this area.					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Later on, I started studying computer engineering at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, and I decided to focus on my technical skills more seriously and strengthen them. So, I started learning Django and React.Js simultaneously, and after a while, I implemented various projects.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Over time, I have been able to work with a variety of technologies and tools, including Django-Rest-Framework, Celery, Nginx, and Django-Channels for the server-side and Redux, TypeScript, Sass, Styled-Components, and Tailwind for the client-side. Also, I'm familiar with Git and Linux-based OSs like ubuntu.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						After that, Front-End became my primary specialty, and I decided to work full time; I also used more technologies such as NextJS.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Due to this journey, I got into web development, which has since become my greatest passion and, fortunately, my job.
